# Welcome to our GitHub classroom!
### You are looking at a README file
The contents of a readme file are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). You view the nicely formatted file when it is displayed on this Github page.

4. Click the green `Commit Changes` button.

5. Done!

### What just happened?
You made changes to a file and committed (saved) them to the repository. Github tracks the state of your entire repository after each commit so you can go back and revisit any point in your commit history.

# Part B. Make more changes to the README file
1. Change your favourite animal to something else. Commit the changes.

2. Make your first name lowercase. Commit the changes.

3. View the commit history by clicking the `Code` tab and then clicking `X Commits`

# Part C. Add and remove java files
Adding and removing files are just more changes to the repository that will get tracked when you make a `commit`.
### Java filenames must be capitalized! -> `Student.java` NOT `student.java`

1. Create a `Student.java` file. Do this by clicking `Add file` -> `Create new file` and name the file `Student.java`. Add the follwing code to that file. Commit your changes.

```
public class Student {
    String firstName;
}
```

2. Modify the `Student.java` file you just created by adding another line of code. Commit the changes.

```
public class Student {
    String firstName;
    int age;
}
```

3. Try adding other types of files like images. Try deleting files. Commit your changes.
